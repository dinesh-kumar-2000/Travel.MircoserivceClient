üéØ Login Flow
Tenant-based authentication via subdomain:
1. User visits tenant subdomain (e.g., dreamtravel.travelsphere.com)
2. Frontend detects tenant from subdomain
3. Login page loads with tenant branding
4. User enters credentials
5. API validates credentials against tenant database
6. JWT token issued with tenant context
7. All subsequent API calls include tenant identifier
8. Role-based redirection (SuperAdmin ‚Üí admin.travelsphere.com, TenantAdmin ‚Üí dashboard, User ‚Üí browse)

üéØ Multi-Tenant Strategy
- Subdomain-based tenant detection (e.g., tenant1.platform.com)
- Database per tenant OR schema per tenant approach
- Tenant context propagated via JWT claims
- Tenant-specific configuration and branding
- Data isolation at database level
- Tenant-aware caching with Redis
- Horizontal scaling per tenant (large tenants get dedicated resources)

üéØ Goal
Build a fully dynamic, scalable, and customizable multi-tenant travel platform with:
- Complete tenant isolation (data, branding, configuration)
- Subdomain-based authentication and routing
- Role-based access control (SuperAdmin, TenantAdmin, User)
- Comprehensive booking management (hotels, flights, packages)
- Integrated payment processing with multiple gateways
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Marketing and promotional tools
- Customer engagement features (chatbot, notifications, loyalty programs)
- Enterprise-grade security and compliance (GDPR, PCI DSS)
- High performance and scalability (10,000+ concurrent users)
- Modern UX with responsive design and PWA support
- Extensible architecture for future enhancements
- Production-ready with CI/CD, monitoring, and DevOps best practices
